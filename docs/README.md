## Making edits

If you're trying to make an edit to the docs, thank you for your contribution! All content is in the `/content` directory.

If you want to preview your modifications, run `yarn` in this folder to install Gatsby, then run `yarn dev` to build and start a local server on port 8000. 

Once you're happy with your changes, open a pull request and we'll be happy to take a look :)

If you're trying to make a modification to all of the core resource sections at once, there's no need to do it by hand. Open an issue with your proposed modifications and we can regenerate them with our template.
