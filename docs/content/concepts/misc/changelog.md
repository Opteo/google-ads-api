This library's changelog: https://github.com/Opteo/google-ads-api/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

Official API changelog: [Google Ads API release notes](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/release-notes)

We do not yet support every feature of the Google Ads API. Currently, these parts are missing:
- Uploading click and call conversions
- Adjusting conversion via uploads
- Listing accessible MCC customers
- Creating new customers
- Generating new keyword ideas
- Using keywordPlans to generate forecasts
- Listing Merchant Center links
- Using the MutateJobService
- Listing payment accounts
- Applying and dismissing Google's recommendations

If any of these features are important to you, help us prioritise by opening an issue on GitHub!
