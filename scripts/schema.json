              "description": "Creates, updates, or removes resources. This method supports atomic\ntransactions with multiple types of resources. For example, you can\natomically create a campaign and a campaign budget, or perform up to\nthousands of mutates atomically.\n\nThis method is essentially a wrapper around a series of mutate methods. The\nonly features it offers over calling those methods directly are:\n\n- Atomic transactions\n- Temp resource names (described below)\n- Somewhat reduced latency over making a series of mutate calls\n\nNote: Only resources that support atomic transactions are included, so this\nmethod can't replace all calls to individual services.\n\n## Atomic Transaction Benefits\n\nAtomicity makes error handling much easier. If you're making a series of\nchanges and one fails, it can leave your account in an inconsistent state.\nWith atomicity, you either reach the desired state directly, or the request\nfails and you can retry.\n\n## Temp Resource Names\n\nTemp resource names are a special type of resource name used to create a\nresource and reference that resource in the same request. For example, if a\ncampaign budget is created with `resource_name` equal to\n`customers/123/campaignBudgets/-1`, that resource name can be reused in\nthe `Campaign.budget` field in the same request. That way, the two\nresources are created and linked atomically.\n\nTo create a temp resource name, put a negative number in the part of the\nname that the server would normally allocate.\n\nNote:\n\n- Resources must be created with a temp name before the name can be reused.\n  For example, the previous CampaignBudget+Campaign example would fail if\n  the mutate order was reversed.\n- Temp names are not remembered across requests.\n- There's no limit to the number of temp names in a request.\n- Each temp name must use a unique negative number, even if the resource\n  types differ.\n\n## Latency\n\nIt's important to group mutates by resource type or the request may time\nout and fail. Latency is roughly equal to a series of calls to individual\nmutate methods, where each change in resource type is a new call. For\nexample, mutating 10 campaigns then 10 ad groups is like 2 calls, while\nmutating 1 campaign, 1 ad group, 1 campaign, 1 ad group is like 4 calls.",
